INTRO

nano-hmac follows in the footsteps of dons' nano-md5 library in an attempt
to create a minimal library that provides access to the HMAC capability
of OpenSSL.

The intent of the library is to be focused just on HMAC.

It is a working release and does pass the tests outlined in RFC's 2104 and 2202.


INSTALL

  % runhaskell Setup.lhs configure
  % runhaskell Setup.lhs build
  % runhaskell Setup.lhs haddock
  % sudo runhaskell Setup.lhs install


NOTES

You may encounter problems building the documentation if you're using
a version of haddock before version 2.0.0.0.


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Many good ideas regarding implementation and testing have been borrowed
from Don Stewart's (dons) nano-md5 library.  Anything that is buggy or
doesn't make sense would be my own unique contribution.
